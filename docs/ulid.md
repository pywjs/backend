# ULID

ULID is one of the **strongest and most balanced** modern options for distributed identifiers— especially when used in human-friendly, URL-safe API or cursor-based pagination.

Refer to the [Adileo’s Awesome Identifiers](https://adileo.github.io/awesome-identifiers/) for detailed comparison of identifiers.

## WHY ULID is a good choice?

- Lexicographically sortable
- Globally unique
- Timestamp-based (good for ordering)
- No "ugly" dashes (unlike UUIDs)
- URL-safe
- Works well in distributed systems
- Readable and compact
- Cursor-based pagination
- Fast* to generate without coordination
